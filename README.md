Univalent Foundations in Cubical Agda
========================================

An open-ended project to encode as much of constructive mathematics as possible, built off Cubical Agda.

This library compiles with the master branch of the development
version of [Agda](https://github.com/agda/agda/). For detailed install
instructions see the
[INSTALL](https://github.com/agda/cubical/blob/master/INSTALL.md)
file.

For an introduction to Cubical Agda, see [Cubical Agda: a dependently typed
programming language with univalence and higher inductive
types](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3341691) by Andrea Vezzosi, Anders
Mörtberg, and Andreas Abel.

The type theory that Cubical Agda implements is a variation of the
cubical type theory of:

[Cubical Type Theory: a constructive interpretation of the univalence
axiom](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02108) - Cyril Cohen, Thierry
Coquand, Simon Huber, Anders Mörtberg.
